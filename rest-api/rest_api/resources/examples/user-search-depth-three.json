Yeah, that's a bit nonsensical. :-) This search operation demonstrates deep nested logic with 'And', 'Or' and 'Not'. It starts with an 'And' search for a user named 'John Doe' and a complex expression. The expression is another 'And' that combines an 'Or' search for 'John Doe' or anyone from company 1000000042, and a 'Not' search that excludes anyone from company 1000000042.",
